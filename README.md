# Overview
This repo is used to build out my personal website, www.kyleducharme.com. I've designed it in a wiki-esque way to help with simplifying navigation and highlighting case studies. The primary tech used for this project are:
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* CSS 
* Browserify
* Grunt
* Dash of HTML
