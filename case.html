                    <p class='study--title'>Edgenet — Lead Product Designer</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>Based in Nashville, TN, Edgenet is a growth-stage SaaS company that's product, utilized by more than 8,000 companies including Lowe's, Home Depot, GE, and Best Buy, makes the process of adding, managing, cleaning, and visualizing product data as simple and effective as possible. The product was originally built in 1990's with Silverlight, so the product's team task was to re-design and re-platform the product utilizing a more modern tech stack while ensuring that existing customers were supported during the migration.</p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Customer Type & User Persona</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>Edgenet's platform is utilized by more than 8,000 businesses including  companies like Best Buy, Lowe's, GE, Honeywell, and more. The platform has two views (1. supplier 2. retailer), and I was responsible for leading the design efforst on the supplier view. For the 'supplier portal', there were two primary user types based on company size:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li><span>Fortune 500 Companies: </span> if a company was at the scale of Honeywell, GE, etc., the primary user of the platform was a young female, typically between the ages of 22-30 in a Marketing Analyst or E-Commerce role, and their sole responsibility was ensuring that the product data was uploaded, accurate, and sent to retailers. These types of users were typically less incentivized, lacked training, and were bored with their day-to-day responsibilities. This position was a stepping stone and a way to 'get their foot in the door' to move onto more exciting roles within the marketing department. The goals for this type of user were ensuring that the process was very simple (since they were not trained well) and included features that were relevant to marketing roles like e-tailer page previews, analytics, etc.</li>
                            <li><span>Small-To-Medium Sized Companies: </span> on the other side of the spectrum, if a company was a startup or in its growth-stage, the primary user of the platform was someone that was later in their career, typically between the ages of 35-50, that were wearing a lot of 'hats'. This responsibility fell on their plate because 1. they were the owner of the business and no one else could do it 2. no one else wanted to do it/someone recently was fired/quit, and it fell on their plate. Having the data uploaded, correct, and distributed to retailers was extremely important to this user because this symbolized growth by expanding operations into retail. The goals for this type of user were to make the process as effective & automated as possible due to their minimal time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Responsibilities</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>As the Lead Product Designer, I was responsible for managing all aspects of the design experience and visual idendity for the re-design of the platform. My day-to-day focus ranged from conducting user interviews and usability tests to designing hi-fidelity mockups and prototypes to working with developers during the implementation phase.</p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Process</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>The following were steps involved in designing a feature during the re-design of the Edgenet platform. (note: these steps were not sequential)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>Interviews: </span> conducted more than 100 interviews with internal and external stakeholders to understand the proble, state of product, and usability. Interviews focused on learning about the core pain point the platform solves, background and interests of users, how users accomplish goals within the product, what their workstation looks like, wishlists/frustrations, and much more. </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Information architecture: </span>created high-level workflows for the architecture of the product based on interviews and card sorting exercises with stakeholders</li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Wireframing & usability tests: </span>developed initial wireframes and goal-oriented usability tests (using Balsamiq) that were conducted on site with existing users to validate architecture and feature assumptions</li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Medium fidelty designs & usability tests: </span>updated product flow and feedback and developed new flow of medium fidelity designs to use for usability tests. Focused on conducting in-person tests during this phase to dive deeper into understanding the user and building rapport</li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Hi-fidelty designs & interactive tests: </span>final iteration and created more interactive prototypes utilizing Proto.io, InVision, or Principle. Conducted usability tests with users utilizing Lookback.io</li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Design handoff </span>created interaction and component guide for developers and led kick-off meeting to build rapport and walk developers through product team's vision</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Visuals</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>A sample visual for the product was the re-design of how suppliers organized, cleaned, and distributed product data to retailers. The feature was revamped to mirror the functionality of creating playlists in Spotify, which significantly simplified the process and ensured that users always knew where they were within the process from start-to-finish.
                    </p>
                    <span class='visuals'>
                        <p>Before: clunky, slow, and outdated UI that was confusing for users and difficult to understand where they were in the process of sending data to a retailer.</p>
                        <img id='edgeOne' src='img/edgenetbefore.jpg'>
                    </span>
                    <span class='visuals'>
                        <p>After: new UI was built to be as simple as possible for users with minimal exposure to technology (most users were recent grads at large companies). Primary focus of view is the product data within the set. </p>

                    <p class='study--title'>WaveFire — Lead Product Designer</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>WaveFire is an early-stage startup that's building a cloud-based platform that simplifies the process
                        of completing a HIPAA securtiy risk analysis in complex organizations. During a six month consultant
                        role, I was responsible with working alongside the founders and technical team to design, test, and
                        implement the user experience and visual design of the platform.</p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Product goals</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>The product helps ensure that businesses of all sizes are compliant with HIPAA regulations and do not
                        have unnecessary risk. With most users being non-technical and unfamiliar with HIPAA regulations,
                        the goals for designing the product were to create simple, intuitive, and modern interface that walks
                        users through the process in a TurboTax-esque experience. </p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Process</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>Creating the WaveFire process followed significantly more iterative process that heavily focused on rapidly
                        prototyping aspects of the product for testing and funding purposes.

                        exceeded (sounds corny, I know) throughout the duration of the project.</p>
