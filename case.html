                    <p class='study--title'>Edgenet — Lead Product Designer</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>Based in Nashville, TN, Edgenet is a growth-stage SaaS company that's product, utilized by more than 8,000 companies including Lowe's, Home Depot, GE, and Best Buy, makes the process of adding, managing, cleaning, and visualizing product data as simple and effective as possible. The product was originally built in 1990's with Silverlight, so the product's team task was to re-design and re-platform the product utilizing a more modern tech stack while ensuring that existing customers were supported during the migration.</p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Responsibilities</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>As the Lead Product Designer, I was responsible for managing the design team and developing the user experience and visual idendity  for the re-design of the platform. My day-to-day focus ranged from conducting user interviews & usability tests to designing hi-fidelity mockups and prototypes.</p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Process</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>The following were  steps involved in designing a feature during the re-design of the Edgenet platform. Please note: these steps were not completely sequential.
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>Interviews: </span> conducted more than 100 interviews with internal and external stakeholders to determine state of product and usability</li>
                            <li><span>Information architecture: </span>created high-level workflows for the architecture of the product based on interviews and card sorting exercises with stakeholders</li>
                            <li><span>Wireframing & usability tests: </span>developed initial wireframes and goal-oriented usability tests (using Balsamiq) that were conducted on site with existing users</li>
                            <li><span>Medium fidelty designs & usability tests: </span>updated product flow and designs to reflect feedback and developed new flow of medium fidelity designs to use for usability tests</li>
                            <li><span>Hi-fidelty designs & interactive tests: </span>final iteration and created more interactive prototypes utilizing Proto.io, InVision, or Principle. </li>
                            <li><span>Design handoff </span>created interaction and component guide for developers and led kick-off meeting to build rapport and walk developers through product team's vision</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class='study--subtitle'>Visuals</p>
                    <p class='study--body'>A sample visual for the product was the re-design of how suppliers organized and sent products to retailers. The feature was revamped to mirror the functionality of creating playlists in Spotify, which significantly simplified the process of adding, cleaning, and sending data within "product sets".
                    </p>
                        <span class='visuals'>
                            <p>Before: clunky, slow, and outdated UI that was confusing for users and difficult to understand where they were in the process of sending data to a retailer.</p>

                        </span>
                        <span class='visuals'>
                            <p>After: new UI was built to be as simple as possible for users with minimal exposure to technology (most users were recent grads at large companies). Primary focus of view is the product data within the set. </p>

                        </span>

                        <p class='study--body'>WaveFire is an early-stage startup that's building a cloud-based platform that simplifies the process of completing a HIPAA securtiy risk analysis in complex organizations. During a six month consultant role, I was responsible with working alongside the founders and technical team to design, test, and implement the user experience and visual design of the platform.</p>
                        <p class='study--subtitle'>Product goals</p>
                        <p class='study--body'>The product helps ensure that businesses of all sizes are compliant with HIPAA regulations and do not have unnecessary risk. With most users being non-technical and unfamiliar with HIPAA regulations, the goals for designing the product were to create simple, intuitive, and modern interface that walks users through the process in a TurboTax-esque experience. </p>
                        <p class='study--subtitle'>Process</p>
                        <p class='study--body'>Creating the WaveFire process followed significantly more iterative process that heavily focused on rapidly prototyping aspects of the product for testing and funding purposes.

                        <p class='study--body'>At the end of the engagement, the product was delivered to the founders in a way that was ready to be developed and utilized to continue fundraising/sales efforts. All deadlines were met and expectations exceeded (sounds corny, I know) throughout the duration of the project.</p>
