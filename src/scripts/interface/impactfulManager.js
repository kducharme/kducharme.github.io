During my years working with non-profits, I found it extremely difficult for organizations to understand the impact that their mission was having on their target audience due to fragmented software, broken processes, and a lack of training. To help overcome this, we're building Impactful, which is a one-stop-shop to manage programs & projects, as well as simplify how digital assets are distributed internally.`);
