Also, the fragmented, outdated system was severely impacting the customer experience due to the registration process being confusing and time-consuming.

            <p class='page__body'> ASP is one of the premier mission trip organizations in the country, and more than 15,000 customers sign up for ASP mission trips per year. Groups primarily are church or civic groups, and the group sizes range from 5 to 200 people. Groups are led by a "contact person" who is responsible for registering, coordinating, and paying on behalf of the group. This person is one of two types of people:</br></br>

            The primary user/customer of ASP is a 24-30 year old male that works full-time at a church, community center, or school. Typically, this type of user is less experienced and is leading a trip for their first time. They are often overwhelmed with the responsibilities, so the experience needs to be as simple and guided as possible.</br></br>

            <p class='page__body'><span class='bold'>Persona 1 (Adult Leader): </span>
            
            About 30% of the time, the user is someone volunteering, typically female between 45-60, that's helping coordinate the trip because their son/daughter is participating as well. This type of user has more time and "forgiveness" for a poor experience but is typically less experienced with technology.

                    <span class='bold'>Interviews: </span> conducted 25+ interviews with internal stakeholders ranging from executives to new employees to understand the state of the organization, technology, and culture.

After two months of rolling out the system, 30% of each employees time was freed up due to standardizing the process, building out a "template" library, and leveraging automation.
