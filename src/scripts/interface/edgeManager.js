            Based in Nashville, TN, Edgenet's product content platform is utilized by more than 10,000 companies and 50,000 individual users including Lowe's, Home Depot, GE, and Best Buy. Edgenet's platform makes the process of adding, managing, cleaning, and visualizing product data as simple and effective as possible. The product was originally built in 1990's with Silverlight, so the product's team task was to re-design and re-platform the product utilizing a more modern tech stack while ensuring that existing customers were supported during the migration. </br></br>

            <p class='case__subtitle'>The problem</p>
            <p class='page__body'> The problem is that the process of collecting, managing, and sending product data (logistics, marketing, etc.) to retailers is extremely complex because every retailer has different product attribute requirements. For example, Walmart might require 50 product attributes but Target requires 15 additional attributes. The goal of the product is to simplify and automate the process by integrating directly with retailers, so that the product can walk users through the process in a way that's simple, quick, and intuitive.

            <p class='page__body'>The Edgenet platform has two views (supplier and retailer), and I was responsible for leading the design efforts on the supplier view. For the 'supplier portal', there were two primary user types: </p></br>

            <p class='page__body'><span class='bold'>Persona 1 (Fortune 500 company): </span>
            
            If the company is at the scale of a Fortune 500 company (GE, Honeywell, Kohler, etc.), the primary user of the platform is a young female, typically between the ages of 22-30 in a Marketing Analyst or E-Commerce role, and their sole responsibility was ensuring that the product data was uploaded, accurate, and sent to retailers. This user were typically less incentivized, lacked training, and were bored with their day-to-day responsibilities. This position was a stepping stone and a way to 'get their foot in the door' to move onto more exciting roles within the marketing department.</br></br>
            
            The UX goals for this type of user were ensuring that the process was very simple (since they were not trained well) and included features that were relevant to marketing roles like e-tailer page previews, analytics, etc.</p></br>
            
            <p class='page__body'><span class='bold'>Persona 2 (Small-To-Medium Sized Companies): </span> 
            
            on the other side of the spectrum, if a company was a startup or in its growth-stage, the primary user of the platform was someone that was later in their career, typically between the ages of 35-50, that were wearing a lot of 'hats'. This responsibility fell on their plate because 1. they were the owner of the business and no one else could do it 2. no one else wanted to do it/someone recently was fired/quit, and it fell on their plate. Having the data uploaded, correct, and distributed to retailers was extremely important to this user because this symbolized growth by expanding operations into retail.</br></br>
            
            The UX goals for this type of user were to focus on integrating automation throughout the product and ensure that the process, from star to finish, was as effective and 'hand-holding' as possible.</p></br>`);

                <li class='page__list'>
                    <span class='bold'>Interviews: </span> conducted more than 100 interviews with internal and external stakeholders to understand the problem, state of product, and usability. Interviews were conducted in stages, and the questions were grouped in 5 'buckets' (profiling, problem, product, situational, solutions), which focused on learning about the core pain point the platform solves, background and interests of users, how users accomplish goals within the product, what their workstation looks like, wishlists/frustrations, and much more. Then, I built out a requirements document to finalize required features. Below is a sample of four of the 10+ pages of requirements and feedback.</br></br>

                    <span class='bold'>Information architecture: </span> working with PM's, customer success, and sales, I led multiple rounds of card sorting exercises with internal and external stakeholds. Based on feedback from participants and requirements from the product team, I created a high-level flow for the product in the form of a flow-chart, which was given the üëç by all internal stakeholders. Example flows for the product is as follows (note: right click and open in new tab):</br></br>

                <li class='page__list'>
                    <span class='bold'>Initial whiteboarding: </span> worked with UX design colleague to conduct co-design session focusing on rapidly creating options (focusing on quantity over quality). At the end, our goal is to develop 10-15 different options for one feature. A sample of what the whiteboard would look like to start is below. I always write the features/needs on the left and rapidly whiteboard as many options as possible to avoid going down one path for too long.</br></br>

                    <span class='bold'>Wireframing & usability tests: </span> developed initial wireframes and two (A/B test) goal-oriented usability tests (using clickable Balsamiq prototype) that were used to conduct tests on-site with 30+ existing users to validate architecture and feature assumptions. An overview of the usability testing strategy can be viewed here:

                    <span class='bold'>Medium fidelity designs & usability tests: </span> product flow was updated based on previous usability tests and fidelity of designs was improved. This stage primarily focused on in-person usability tests or utilizing Lookback.io for remote tests (both using InVision for testing), which helped dive deeper into their usage and build rapport with users.

                    <span class='bold'>Hi-fidelity designs & interactive tests: </span> product improved based on previous testing, and a more interactive prototype was built using Proto.io or Principle.
